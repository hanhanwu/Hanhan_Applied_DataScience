## Applied Recommendations
### Data Exploration
#### Univariate Analysis
* Check distribution for continuous, categorical variables
  * For continuous variables, in many cases, I just check percentile at min, 1%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, 99% and max. This is easier to implement and even more straightforward to find the outliers.
  * For categorical data, you can also find whether there is data inconsistency issue, and based on the cause to preprocess the data
* Check null percentage
* Check distinct values count and percentage

#### Bivariate Analysis
* Check correlation between every 2 continuous variables
* 2 way table or Stacked Column Chart - for 2 variable variables, check count, percentage of group by the 2 variables
* Check chi-square test between 2 categorical features (similar to correlation for continuous features)
  * probability 0 means the 2 variables are dependent; 1 means independent; a value x in [0,1] range means the dependence between the 2 variables is at `(1-x)*100%`
* Check ANOVA between categorical and continuous variables
  * [Example to check ANOVA f-value][2]
  * [Sklearn ANOVA][3]
  * Lower F-score the higher dependent between the variables
  * Besides ANOVA, we could calculate t-score or z-score (less than 30 records)
* Feature selection based on the dependency between features and the label
  * Select features that have stronger correlation with the label, because these features tend to contribute to the label values.
  * correlation: continuous features vs continuous label
  * chi-square: categorical features vs categorical label
    * Cramerâ€™s V for Nominal Categorical Variable (categorical values in numerical format)
    * Mantel-Haenszed Chi-Square for ordinal categorical variable (categorical values in order)
  * ANOVA: categorical features vs cotinuous label; or vice versa
