* [Original Paper][1]
* This paper presents a simple data-preprocessing scheme that transforms high-cardinality categorical attributes into quasicontinuous scalar attributes suited for use in regression-type models. The key transformation used in the proposed scheme is one that maps each instance (value) of a high-cardinality categorical to the probability estimate of the target attribute. In a classification scenario, the numerical representation corresponds to the posterior probability of the target, conditioned by the value of the categorical attribute. In a prediction scenario, the numerical representation corresponds to the expected value of the target given the value of the categorical attribute.
