# Flask ML Web Application Basics

## Required files/folders
* `templates/`
  * This is the required folder for running flask, you can put web pages in this folder
* To deploy the web application on Heroku
  * `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` are required

## To run flask locally
* By default, the web application is running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  * So don't run ipython at the same time and the code cannot be written in ipython
