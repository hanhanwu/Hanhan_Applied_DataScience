# Experience Notes ❣️

Not sure why my previous experience notes disappeared. But it's very simple to start this new one, cuz when you are working in the industry, working with people who are quite different, there could always be something to talk. Maybe this time I can make these as case study format.

## Case 1 - Most Stressful Deploy Week
### The Story
* The project has very confusing QA user stories at the very beginning, which is quite different from what they really should test. You asked multiple times what they need for deployment testing, no one tried to help you understand how are they going to test, including their QA, but they still required you to provide the data immediately.
* In the last week of deployment, all of a sudden, they are asking for everything from you for QA test, and kept asking you why there is discrepency. What the hell.
* Your DS team has more projects than people, meanwhile there is one person kept all his code without sharing with the team, until the last minute. No one had time to do further data quality validation. You manager could only express his anger towards that person in fornt of you, but when that person just doesn't share the code, nothing really changed. Very unfortunately, you are the person need to put everything together. Finally that person provided the code, lots of features cannot be implemented on production, and costs you so much time to debug. You have already tried your best to avoid te mistake, no one really review you code or help you double check, later when there is any problem, you take all the responsibility. Even when you are willing to take the responsibility, there will be people blame you.
* You spent lots of time to help them figure out the issues, without blaming them anything. Meanwhile you have to handle tasks in other projects. However, some people will take your credit for solving the problem, and when there is issue, you and your team got blamed, they totally forgot all those mistakes they made and all the kindness you gave them. Holy sh*t.
* You manager doesn't want to see you are spending much time to support them, telling you not to provide something but just to wait, and later in the last minute he became the person asking everything from you, even when some are not your work. 
* Every time, when you tried to push that team member to submit his code asap, your manager will say something sounds like no rush. Then when it became critical, problems happened and you became the target to be blamed.
### Lessons Learned
* Ask them how are they going to do deployment QA at the very beginning. Provide every output at each step.
* Push everyone to put all the code together on time, after combining the code, re-run everything asap, to reduce potential discrepencies later.
